## Number Systems & Basic Algebra {#number-systems}

### Important Formulas
- (a + b)Â² = aÂ² + bÂ² + 2ab
- (a - b)Â² = aÂ² + bÂ² - 2ab
- (a + b)(a - b) = aÂ² - bÂ²
- (a + b + c)Â² = aÂ² + bÂ² + cÂ² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
- aÂ³ + bÂ³ = (a + b)(aÂ² - ab + bÂ²)
- aÂ³ - bÂ³ = (a - b)(aÂ² + ab + bÂ²)

### Quick Tricks

**1. Square Root Calculation**
To find âˆš2116:
- Step 1: Last digit is 6 â†’ possible squares: 4Â² = 16, 6Â² = 36
- Step 2: First digits "21" â†’ closest squares: 4Â² = 16, 5Â² = 25
- Step 3: Since 4Ã—5 = 20 < 21, answer is 46

**Example:** âˆš1024
- Last digit 4 â†’ 2Â² = 4, 8Â² = 64
- First digits "10" â†’ 3Â² = 9
- Since 3Ã—4 = 12 > 10, answer is 32

**2. Multiplication Shortcuts**
For 381Â² + 597Â²:
- 381Â² ends in 1 (since 1Â² = 1)
- 597Â² ends in 9 (since 7Â² = 49)
- Sum ends in 0, so check options ending in 0

### Practice Problems
1. Simplify: 3x + 5x - 2 = **8x - 2**
2. Find âˆš1225: **35** (3Ã—4=12, 5Â²=25 â†’ 1225)
3. Calculate (23)Â²: **(20+3)Â² = 400 + 120 + 9 = 529**

## Percentages {#percentages}

### Core Formulas
- Percentage = (Part/Whole) Ã— 100
- Part = (Percentage Ã— Whole)/100
- Whole = (Part Ã— 100)/Percentage

### Quick Reference Table
| Fraction | Percentage | Decimal |
|----------|------------|---------|
| 1/2 | 50% | 0.5 |
| 1/3 | 33.33% | 0.333 |
| 1/4 | 25% | 0.25 |
| 1/5 | 20% | 0.2 |
| 1/8 | 12.5% | 0.125 |
| 1/10 | 10% | 0.1 |

### Speed Tricks

**1. 10% Method**
- 10% of any number = number Ã· 10
- 20% = 10% Ã— 2
- 5% = 10% Ã· 2
- 30% = 10% Ã— 3

**Example:** 20% of 350
- 10% of 350 = 35
- 20% = 35 Ã— 2 = **70**

**2. Percentage Change Formula**
If A is x% more than B, then B is x/(100+x) Ã— 100% less than A

**Example:** A is 25% more than B. B is what % less than A?
- B is 25/(100+25) Ã— 100 = 25/125 Ã— 100 = **20%** less than A

### Practice Problems
1. What is 15% of 240? **36**
2. 45 is what % of 180? **25%**
3. If price increases by 25%, by what % should consumption decrease to maintain same expenditure? **20%**

## Profit & Loss {#profit-loss}

### Essential Formulas
- Profit = SP - CP (when SP > CP)
- Loss = CP - SP (when CP > SP)
- Profit% = (Profit/CP) Ã— 100
- Loss% = (Loss/CP) Ã— 100
- SP = CP Ã— (100 + Profit%)/100
- CP = SP Ã— 100/(100 + Profit%)

### Quick Tricks

**1. Same Selling Price Trick**
When two articles are sold at same price with x% profit on first and x% loss on second:
- **Always results in loss**
- Loss% = (x/10)Â²

**Example:** Two articles sold at â‚¹1200 each, 20% profit on first, 20% loss on second
- Loss% = (20/10)Â² = 4%

**2. Successive Profit/Loss**
- Net% = a + b + (ab/100) for profits
- Net% = a - b - (ab/100) for profit and loss

**Example:** 10% profit followed by 20% profit
- Net profit = 10 + 20 + (10Ã—20)/100 = 30 + 2 = **32%**

### Practice Problems
1. CP = â‚¹500, SP = â‚¹600. Find profit%: **20%**
2. Two items sold at â‚¹100 each, 25% profit on first, 25% loss on second. Net result: **6.25% loss**
3. After 15% profit and 10% loss, net result: **3.5% profit**

## Time & Work {#time-work}

### Fundamental Formulas
- Work Rate = 1/Time taken
- Combined Rate = Sum of individual rates
- Work Done = Time Ã— Rate
- If A completes work in n days, work done in 1 day = 1/n

### Universal Formula
Mâ‚Dâ‚Wâ‚‚ = Mâ‚‚Dâ‚‚Wâ‚
Where M = Men, D = Days, W = Work

### Quick Methods

**1. Efficiency Method**
If A is twice as efficient as B:
- A takes half the time of B
- If B takes 6 days, A takes 3 days

**2. Combined Work Formula**
If A takes a days and B takes b days:
- Together they take (ab)/(a+b) days

**Example:** A completes work in 12 days, B in 18 days
- Combined time = (12Ã—18)/(12+18) = 216/30 = **7.2 days**

### Practice Problems
1. A can do work in 15 days, B in 20 days. Together: **60/7 â‰ˆ 8.57 days**
2. 12 men complete work in 8 days. How many days for 16 men? **6 days**
3. A and B together complete work in 6 days. A alone takes 10 days. B alone takes: **15 days**

## Speed, Time & Distance {#speed-time-distance}

### Basic Formulas
- Speed = Distance/Time
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time
- Time = Distance/Speed

### Unit Conversions
- km/h to m/s: multiply by 5/18
- m/s to km/h: multiply by 18/5

### Speed Tricks

**1. Average Speed**
For equal distances at different speeds:
Average Speed = (2 Ã— Sâ‚ Ã— Sâ‚‚)/(Sâ‚ + Sâ‚‚)

**Example:** 60 km at 30 km/h, return at 60 km/h
- Average Speed = (2Ã—30Ã—60)/(30+60) = 3600/90 = **40 km/h**

**2. Relative Speed**
- Same direction: |Sâ‚ - Sâ‚‚|
- Opposite direction: Sâ‚ + Sâ‚‚

**3. Train Problems**
Time to cross = (Lâ‚ + Lâ‚‚)/Relative Speed

### Practice Problems
1. Convert 72 km/h to m/s: **20 m/s**
2. 240 km in 4 hours. Speed: **60 km/h**
3. Two trains 100m each, speeds 50 km/h and 40 km/h, opposite direction. Time to cross: **8 seconds**
